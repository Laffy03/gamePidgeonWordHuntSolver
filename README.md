Installation Instructions:

Start by navigating to the "Releases" tab in GitHub (located right below "About")

Windows Users:
1. Download the `.zip` file for Windows
2. Extract all files
3. Run `gamePigeonWordHuntSolver.exe`
4. If Windows Security shows a warning, click "More Info" then "Run Anyway"
    - *This appears because I don't have a Windows code signing certificate yet*

macOS Users:
1. Download the `.zip` file for macOS
2. Extract the application
3. **Right-click** on `gamePigeonWordHuntSolver.app`
4. Select "Open" from the menu
5. Click "Open" in the security dialog
    - *This is needed because I'm not paying $99/year (yikes) to have my app notarized by Apple*
